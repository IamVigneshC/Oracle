## Shipment

The type of shipping documents that you will have the option to use include an 

**advance shipping notice**-- this is transmitted via EDI from a supplier to let the receiving organization know that a shipment is coming; 

**a packing slip**-- this is a listing of the items packed within a particular carton. The packing slips can be especially useful for shipments that are packed into multiple cartons; 

**the bill of lading**-- the bill of lading lists all items in a shipment destined for a particular ship-to location; and 

**a commercial invoice**-- this is a customs document that lists all confirmed shipping items in a delivery, shipments date, commercial invoice ID, shipper and exporters, ship-to address, exporter ID numbers, freight carriers, country of origin, and all the information it would need to accompany.
